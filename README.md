# 🎵 VibeCheck AI  
**Internet of Agents Hackathon @ Solana Skyline — Version 1.0**  
[🌐 Live Demo](https://vibecheck-ai.streamlit.app/)  

---

## 🚀 Overview  
VibeCheck AI is an **AI-powered sentiment analysis and mood visualization app** that leverages **Coral Protocol** to orchestrate agents in the **Internet of Agents** ecosystem.  

Our mission is simple: **help communities, creators, and organizations measure the vibe in real time** — whether it’s a live event, a digital space, or social media chatter.  

This project was built for **two hackathon tracks**:  
- ✅ **App Builder Track** — a production-ready app with working UI.  
- ✅ **Multi-Agent App Track** — demonstrating orchestration of multiple agents (sentiment, context, visualization) working together via Coral Protocol.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
In today’s digital world, emotions spread faster than facts.  
Communities, brands, and creators lack **real-time, actionable insights** into the *vibe* of their audiences. Traditional analytics miss the subtle nuances of human emotion.  

**VibeCheck AI solves this gap** by using multiple AI agents that analyze mood from text inputs, understand context, and visualize insights interactively.

## 💡 Multi-Agent Solution  
VibeCheck AI demonstrates **multi-agent collaboration** powered by **Coral Protocol**:  

1. **Sentiment Agent**  
   - Detects emotional tone (positive, neutral, negative).  

2. **Context Agent**  
   - Analyzes time-based mood trends and contextual shifts.  

3. **Visualization Agent**  
   - Converts processed sentiment data into interactive Plotly dashboards.  

4. **Orchestration (Coral Protocol)**  
   - Agents communicate securely and coordinate tasks in real time.
